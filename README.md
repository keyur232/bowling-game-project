- Input validation (pins range 0â€“10, frame totals â‰¤ 10, no rolls after game completion)  
- Unit tests (12 scenarios) using Pythonâ€™s `unittest`  
- Refactored, optimized, and documented code with PythonDoc  

## Files
- `bowling_game.py` â†’ main game logic  
- `test_bowling_game.py` â†’ unit test suite  
- `TEST_PLAN.md` â†’ test plan, scope, risks, and traceability  
- `SUMMARY_REPORT.md` â†’ findings, refactoring, Git usage, recommendations  
- `bowling_game.html` â†’ generated PythonDoc documentation
